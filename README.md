# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, we have to use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is provided, using which we have to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Requirements
The requirements for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

# 1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
1. In the starter code notebook, complete the following steps:
  a. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
  b. Create the labels set (`y`) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (`X`) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
  c. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.
